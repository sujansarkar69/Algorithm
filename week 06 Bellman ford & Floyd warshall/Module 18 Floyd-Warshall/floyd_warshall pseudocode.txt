Pseudocode: Floyd-Warshall

Input -> A weighted graph as an adjacency matrix
Output -> All pair shortest distance

- create a distance_matrix "d" where d[i][j] == x where there is a direct
  edge from node "i" to node "j" and the cost is "x"
- for all node "i" d[i][i] = 0
- for all nodes "u" & "v" where there isn't any direct edge from "i" to "j", 
  d[i][j] = INF

- for all node "k"
  - for all node "u"
    - for all node "v"
      - d[u][v] = min(d[u][v], d[u][k] + d[k][v])

- output all pair shortest distance "d"
