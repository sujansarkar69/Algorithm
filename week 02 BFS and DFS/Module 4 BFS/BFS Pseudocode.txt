Pseudocode of BFS
=================

Time Complexity: O(V+E)
Space Complexity: O(V)

Input -> Connected Graph and a "Source" node
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the Traversal order

BFS(Graph,Source):

- Initiate an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"
- mark visited[Source] = 1 and q.push(Source)
- while the queue is not empty:
    - head = q.front()
    - q.pop()
    - print the node "head"
    - for all Adjacency nodes of "head":
        - if visited[Source]==0:
            - visited[adj_node] = 1 and q.push(adj_node)
